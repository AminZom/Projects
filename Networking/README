================================================================
To get familiar with using tcpdump, you are required to use it to view
the network traffic your assignment 1 program generates. tcpdump is
installed on the Friend 010 lab machines in /usr/sbin/tcpdump. For
example, to listen for traffic on port 80, you can run the following:

   /usr/sbin/tcpdump port 80

Use tcpdump to view some packets that your program is
transmitting. Describe below what you see. Also include a few lines of
the tcpdump output and the command you ran.
