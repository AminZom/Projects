Build Instructions
******************
To build the parser, type the following into the terminal:

        make
      
The cup file required for this is in the school server location:

        /usr/share/java/cup.jar:.

*****************
Test Instructions
*****************
To run any of the test programs, type the following into the terminal:

        java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main [12345].cm
        
To show the abstract syntax tree, add -a to the line above:

        java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main [12345].cm -a
    
The [12345] would be replaced by the number of the test program to be ran.

To show the symbol table, add -s to the run command :

        java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main [12345].cm -s 
    
    *it is recommended that you output the symbol tree to a file
    because if there are errors, they will both be output to the screen 
    and the format of the table will be harder to read.
     
        java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main [12345].cm -s > output.txt
