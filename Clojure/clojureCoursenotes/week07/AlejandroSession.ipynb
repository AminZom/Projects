    "## Part 1: General Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent computing refers to the form of computing where multiple computations are made at the same time (in parallel) in a system instead of sequentially. Each computation must have its own point of execution for a system to be trully concurrent. In other words, you require a processor for every process.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU speeds are not increasing at the same rate as they used to. This is due to higher speeds requiring more power exponentially. More power -> more heat\n",
    "As a result, chip manufactures have been focusing on adding more cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means....\n",
    "Parallelism is going to become increasingly important moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "<img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/meme/images/4/42/1385136139955.png/revision/latest?cb=20150207013804\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"100\" align=\"left\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your program can be much faster\n",
    "T(parallel) = (T(serial)/ IndependentNumberOfProcesses) + T(overhead)\n",

    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "Parallel programs can be much more complex to write and much more complex to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pit Falls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deadlock\n",
    "    Multiple threads are wating for the same resource and the system comes to a halt.\n",
    "        e.g. Dining Philosophers\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Reference Cell Problem\n",
    "    Multiple threads are reading/writing to the same location and memory and as a result the value depends on the execution order of the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutual Exclusion, a recipe for disaster\n",
    "    Multiple threads are reading/writing multiple instructions to a data source and as a result the data becomes jumbled.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Imagine 2 threads trying to write recipes for to a file.\n",
    "        The first states:\n",
    "            \"Boil Water in pot\"\n",
    "            \"Add egg to pot\"\n",
    "            \"Wait 3 minutes\"\n",
    "            \"Remove Egg\"\n",
    "        The second states:\n",
    "            \"Mix Flour and sugar in pot\"\n",
    "            \"Mix in Milk\"\n",
    "            \"Put in microwave for 5 minutes\"\n",
    "            \n",
    "    If the file does not enforce mutual exclusion you can potentially end up with:\n",
