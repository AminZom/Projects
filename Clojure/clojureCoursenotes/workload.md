
## Required Milestones: 

- 25% Plan and lead a class session  
- 20% Complete exercises and contribute during weekly classes (2%/week * 10 weeks) 
- 25% Instructional materials for one portion of the 'course' 
	- Basically we're going to write a textbook that could be used in a functional programming course that uses clojure 
	- Your job will be to help write specific sections and design exercises 
	- And provide solutions for the exercises 
	- And organize your 'chapter' of it 
- 30% your choice.. A project,  more instructional videos,  more leading of our group,   

## Proposal ideas 
- Investigate the applications of functional programming to modern programming tasks such as data science and web development. 
- Expand understand of programming paradigms. 
- Explore the relationship of functional programming to more common programming paradigms like object-oriented programming and procedural programming. 


## Learning Outcomes For this 4900/4910 course 
- Build programs using  Clojureâ€™s core function library. 
- Approach programming problems from a functional programming mindset. 
- Employ functional programming to solve a data science problem 
- Use Clojure to create a web application
