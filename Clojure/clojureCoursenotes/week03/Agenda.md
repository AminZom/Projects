## Todays Activities

We're going to dive into the core functionality today by following the 4th chapter of [Brave Clozure](https://www.braveclojure.com/core-functions-in-depth/)

Work in partners again, but work with a different partner than you did last week.

### Concepts you should understand at the end of the day

- Vectors, Lists, Sets, Maps
- Sequences
  - Functions for sequence abstraction
    - first, rest, next, cons
    - see the cheat sheet for others
  - Difference between a Sequence and a Lazy Sequence
- Collections
  - into
  - conj
- Functions as data
  - apply
  - partial



Try to implement the data analysis program at the end of the chapter.  If you don't want to implement a vampire analysis program,  pick any other rating-management you feel like thinking about  (bird-course ratings?  coffee quality? )?

I took the liberty of starting the project for you and committing it to the  shared repo.   Don't feel you have to use it.
