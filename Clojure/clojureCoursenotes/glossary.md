# The CIS*4900 General Glossary for Clojure

## Helpful (and more complete) collections of info:

- http://clojuredocs.org/quickref
  - A quick-reference guide with links to a lot of ClojureDocs pages. Use for completeness, and if you're not afraid of Rich's shorthands.
- https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet
  - A Clojure "cheatsheet" which is basically a compressed list of the ClojureDocs quick reference
- https://clojure.org/reference/reader
  - A whole bunch of articles about general topics in Clojure. A bit hard to digest at-first, but can be helpful if you need a re-explanation of a topic you've forgotten.
- https://www.braveclojure.com/
  - An online version of the textbook called "Clojure for the Brave and True". Great for beginners with easy-to-follow topics, and it's not too stale of a read either. 
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/clojure/index.htm
  - The Tutorialspoint guide for Clojure. This is a bit dated, and follows a very specific setup that only works for Windows machines. Still not a bad way to learn by any means, just a little bit situational.

## Glossary of terms

*These terms are shorthands/jargon often used in ClojureDocs. I am documenting them here because I can never remember what the heck conj means. (is it conjoin? is it conjugate? is it conjecture? is it conjure?)*

*coll* = Collection. This could be a List, Map, Lazy-sequence, Vector, Set, etc. Here's a handy [list of collections](http://clojuredocs.org/quickref#collections)

*fn* = an anonymous function, things such as [partial](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/partial) return these.

*conj* = short for [conj](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/conj)oin (might just be a horrible LISP-y misnomar). Also Conj is a [clojure conference](https://twitter.com/clojure_conj)
