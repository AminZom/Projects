    "## Some Notes About Style in Clojure\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the \"holy grail\" of Clojure style guides: https://guide.clojure.style/ (and you can even contribute to it at https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Things, Summarized\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Namespaces\n",
    "    - Should be in the format `project.module` or `organization.project.module`\n",
    "    - Use `lisp-case` in composite namespace segments (e.g. `uoguelph.cis4900.really-cool-clojure-project`)\n",
    "- Variables and Functions\n",
    "    - Also should be `lisp-case`\n",
    "    - Good:\n",
    "        - `(defn some-variable)`\n",
    "        - `(defn some-function)`\n",
    "    - Bad\n",
    "        - `(defn bad_name)`\n",
    "        - `(def myInteger)`\n",
    "        - `(def BigBeanBurrito)`\n",
    "    - Predicates (functions that return true or false, like `even?`) should end with a question mark (?).\n",
    "        - Therefore, you shouldn't see `(is-a-map)` or `(is-some-condition)`\n",
    "        - This leads to things like `(map)` and `(map?)` meaning quite different things\n",
    "    - Conversion functions should use `->` in their names instead of `-to-`\n",
    "        - e.g. instead of having a function `str-to-int` it should be `str->int`.\n",
    "    - Do **not** use any special notation for constants.\n",
    "        - Everything is assumed to be a constant unless specified otherwise\n",
    "- Idiomatic Names\n",
    "    - *Rant: The below suggestions convey the idea that one should follow the conventions set out by Clojure's core library, which (in general) I agree with. However, some of these are terrible variable names, and I refuse to use pointless shorthand to uphold brevity over clarity. As such, I will probably not be following some these idiomatic names in this lesson.*\n",
    "    - Discussion point: What do you think of these idiomatic names?\n",
    "    - in functions:\n",
    "        - `f`, `g`, `h` - function input\n",
    "        - `n` - integer input usually a size\n",
    "        - `index`, `i` - integer index\n",
    "        - `x`, `y` - numbers\n",
    "        - `xs` - sequence\n",
    "        - `m` - map\n",
    "        - `s` - string input\n",
    "        - `re` - regular expression\n",
    "        - `coll` - a collection\n",
    "        - `pred` - a predicate closure\n",
    "        - `& more` - variadic input\n",
    "        - `xf` - xform, a transducer\n",
    "    - in macros:\n",
    "        - `expr` - an expression\n",
    "        - `body` - a macro body\n",
    "        - `binding` - a macro binding vector\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tabs vs. Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two spaces.** (in general, there's quite a few exceptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Then shalt thou indent the body of the function to two, no more, no less. Two shall be the number thou shalt indent, and the number of the indenting shall be two. Three shalt thou not indent, neither indent thou one, excepting that thou then proceed to two. Four is right out."
